/*i think the easiest way to make this game work is to have the player remain stationary
and the obstacles move toward the player. then the player can either duck or jump
honestly this is super similar to how our bird game worked. The main difference is instead of randomly
placing the enemies, there are only two locations, ground or air.*/
